# cyber-security-podcasts
A big list of IT Security / Cybersecurity Podcasts

Tanya Janca ([@shehackspurple](https://twitter.com/shehackspurple/s)) asked on [The Twitters](https://twitter.com/shehackspurple/status/1341920266021027842) The other day "What are your favourite security podcasts? Name as many as you want. :-D" and there was a HUGE response. I pulled out all the links I could and collected them here. Let me know if I missed your favorite.
