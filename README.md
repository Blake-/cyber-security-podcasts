A curated playlist of Operational Technology and ICS Cyber Security related podcast episodes : https://www.listennotes.com/listen/beerisac-cpsics-security-podcast-playlist-j-G0QwC8Zsu/?display=episode



This list started from Twitter where Tanya Janca ([@shehackspurple](https://twitter.com/shehackspurple/s)) asked on [The Twitters](https://twitter.com/shehackspurple/status/1341920266021027842)  `"What are your favourite security podcasts? Name as many as you want. :-D"` and there was a HUGE response. I pulled out all the links I could and collected them here. I continue adding in every other current podcast I can find.
